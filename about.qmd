It draws on desk research that looked through >300 publications from civil society organisations that were flagged as having some relevance to poverty research. This document has fed into the findings of our interim summary report for our project, available [here](https://rss.org.uk/news-publication/news-publications/2025/general-news/rss-launches-new-project-on-poverty-data-gaps/), which outlines the methodology used for extracting data gaps from publications. 

If you have experience working with data that relate to poverty or adjacent subjects, we welcome your contributions to this tool. Please complete our form below to contribute to our research by highlighting poverty data gaps in your research area that you believe we should be aware of.
